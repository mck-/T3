[Multiplayer Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe on AngularFire](http://mck-.github.io/T3)

The game consists of 9 Tic-Tac-Toe boards. The goal is to get three boards in a row.

Rules:

- The first player to get three-in-a-row on a board, owns the board forever
- Your move decides the board your opponent gets to move in next. For example, when you make a move to claim the center square (on any given board), your opponent's next move must be on the center board
- When you get sent to a board that is already full, you get to go anywhere
- When a board ends up in a tie, the board belongs to nobody
- Happy Tic-Tac-Toeing!
